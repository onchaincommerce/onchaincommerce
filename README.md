Crypto payments are the future of Commerce! 

I've built a Coinbase Commerce Wrapper than enables merchants to seamlessly onboard via Coinbase Smart Wallet. 

For now, the Coinbase Commerce API information is pulled via local storage and isn't encrypted - I currently don't have bandwidth to build out a backend server for storing this information. 

Use at your own peril....
